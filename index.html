            <p>Hi there! I currently reside in Clawson, but grew up in Detroit and Warren. Clawson 
                is a small quiet town near Troy and Madison Heights. It's conveniently located near many stores. 
                The neighborhood is a great place to walk when it's warmer out and is ranked as one of the 
                safest cities in the state.
            </p>

            <h2>DEVELOPING</h2>
            <p>My developing experience ranges from sites like Codecademy to Treehouse, Udacity, CodeWars, 
                The Firehose Project and Edabit. I also took a few programming classes my senior year of
            college. Currently, I'm enrolled in the Grand Circus C#/.Net bootcamp. We are in the process
            of learning Front end and I don't think I'm a fan of it.</p>
